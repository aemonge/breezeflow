# BreezeFlow - A Lighter AirFlow - Task Orchestration

`breezeflow` is a lightweight task orchestration tool designed for efficient and safe 
execution of concurrent tasks. It is inspired by Apache Airflow but is optimized for 
simplicity, performance, and cross-platform compatibility. 

## Features

- **Performance**: Optimized for large-scale task orchestration.
- **Safety**: Gleam's strong type system ensures reliability and prevents runtime    
    errors.
- **Concurrency**: Efficient parallel execution with Gleam's concurrency model.
- **Cross-platform**: Portable binaries for all major OSes.
- **Extensibility**: Integration with Gleam's growing ecosystem.

## Usage

`breezeflow` orchestrates tasks with options for concurrent execution, success/failure 
callbacks, and retries. Below is an overview of its functionality.

### Options

- `-w, --while <command>`: Command to run concurrently with the main command.
- `-s, --succeed <command>`: Command to run if the main command succeeds.
- `-f, --fail <command>`: Command to run if the main command fails.
- `--delay <seconds>`: (default: 1) Delay between retry attempts for `--while`, 
    `--succeed`, and `--fail`.
- `--max-attempts <number>`: (default: 3) Maximum retry attempts for `--while`, 
    `--succeed`, and `--fail`.
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose output for debugging.

### Examples

1. **Run a long command without a "while" command**:

```{bash}
breezeflow 'sleep 2'
```

2. **Run a command with a "while" command to monitor progress**:

```{bash}
breezeflow 'sleep 5' -w 'echo "Main command is running..."'
```

3. **Simulate success with a callback**:

```{bash}
breezeflow 'sleep 2 && true' -s 'echo "Success!"'
```

4. **Simulate failure with retries**:

```{bash}
breezeflow 'sleep 2 && false' -f 'echo "Failure!"' \
   --delay 2 --max-attempts 5
```

5. **Combine all options with verbose output**:

```{bash}
breezeflow 'sleep 5' -w 'echo "Monitoring..."' \
   -s 'echo "Done!"' -f 'echo "Failed!"' \
   --delay 1 --max-attempts 3 -v
```

### Notes

- The tool returns the exit code of the main command for caller feedback.
- Commands can be shell commands or exported functions.
- Use `-v, --verbose` to enable debug output for retries and progress.

## Why Gleam?

The choice of Gleam brings several advantages:

- **Performance**: Gleam's lightweight runtime ensures efficient task execution.
- **Safety**: Gleam's strong type system and immutability prevent runtime errors.
- **Concurrency**: Gleam's actor-based concurrency model enables efficient parallelism.
- **Cross-platform**: Gleam's portability simplifies deployment across OSes.
- **Extensibility**: Integration with Gleam's ecosystem enhances functionality.
